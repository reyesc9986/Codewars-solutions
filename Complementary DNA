#Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

#If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

#In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

#DNA_strand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"

#DNA_strand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"

def DNA_strand(dna):
    # Utilize a bunch of if statements.
    # Don't need to deal with case here.
    #also need to loop through the given input.
    #think i need char.replace here. Otherwise I can make a new string.
    #this answer will just create new answer string. Probably solveable with char.replace, but I don't want to change the given
    #string
    ans = ''
    for char in dna:
        if char ==  "A":
            ans += "T"
        elif char == "T":
            ans += 'A'
        elif char == "G":
            ans += "C"
        elif char == "C":
            ans += "G"
    return(ans)
